# Memory Game
by Dmitri Christopher

## Description:
A memory matching game using html, css, and javascript created for the Udacity Intro to Programming Nanodegree.

## How to Start:
Download the repository and open index.html file

## Rules:
The game randomly assigns 8 pairs of Rune symbols to 16 cards. Each card will flip over when the player clicks it, revealing the symbol on its back. When the player flips a second card, if the card matches the first both cards will remain flipped. If they do not match they will flip over again.
When all the cards are flipped, the game is won. The player is given a score based on the total number of moves it took to complete the game, and that total time.

## The game uses the following:

JQuery: https://jquery.com/
JQuery UI: https://jqueryui.com/
